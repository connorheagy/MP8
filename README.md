One sentence description/purpose: In this mini-project, I explored how to implement circular doublely linked lists using a dummy node as well as learning about the fail fast policy.

Resources/acknowledgements: Evening tutor (helped my understand the logic of using a dummy node and drew pictures of how add works)

link to GitHub:

instructions for running: using the SimpleCDLLTest file, you can test that the implimented methods are working correctly.

Paragraph about using dummy node and circular lists: 
Using a dummy node made the implimentation of the add method a lot easier becuase it eliminated most of the special cases. Spefically, we no longer had to find the head and tail of the list because it was always dummy.prev and dummy.next respectively. While using the dummy node was helpful, the change to the doubley linked list being circular also made it easier to impliment methods. The effiencty of using both of these design methods created easy of implimentation and reduce the sherr amount of code need to be written.
