One sentence description/purpose: In this mini-project, I explored how to implement circular doubly linked lists using a dummy node as well as learning about the fail-fast policy.

Resources/acknowledgments: Evening tutor (helped me understand the logic of using a dummy node and drew pictures of how the add method works)

instructions for running: using the SimpleCDLLTest file, you can test that the implemented methods are working correctly.

Paragraph about using dummy node and circular lists: 
Using a dummy node made the implementation of the add method a lot easier because it eliminated most of the special cases. Specifically, we no longer had to find the head and tail of the list because it was always dummy.prev and dummy.next respectively. While using the dummy node was helpful, the change to the doubly linked list being circular also made it easier to implement methods. The efficiency of using both of these design methods created easy of implementation and reduced the sheer amount of code needed to be written.
